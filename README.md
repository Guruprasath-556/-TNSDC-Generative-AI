Online Food Order Feedback Prediction using RNN

This study uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to anticipate the feedback (positive or negative) of online food orders. The model predicts whether the feedback will be favourable or unfavourable by analysing a number of characteristics pertaining to the online meal orders.


With the use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, our main objective is to provide accurate and consistent feedback predictions to support decision-making in the online food sector.

Our goal is to provide stakeholders with a solid solution for improving customer happiness, operational efficiency, and strategic decision-making in response to changing feedback dynamics through comprehensive data analysis, model refinement, and validation.
